REST Server

.. consider usage of https://github.com/unaguil/sphinx-swaggerdoc
   IT does not work at the moment becuase flask restplus generates (see: https://github.com/noirbizarre/flask-restplus/issues/196)

This documentation is autogenerated from the Swagger API Specification using `sphinx-swaggerdoc`_.

A better documentation for the REST API can be found directly in the REST Server:

1. Launch the server
2. Open http://localhost:5000/api/v1/

.. swaggerv2doc:: file://{{currentDir}}/swagger-apiv1.json
