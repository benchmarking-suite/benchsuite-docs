# Autodoc needed modules

# Since we want to include also the documentation for the benchsuite.core module, we take it from source to get the
# latest version

# Put this before the benchsuite.controller because the latter needs the former during the build. In theory, pip
# does not assure to install the packages in order, but practically, it seems to follow it
